** Swift(y) Planner **

## **📌 Project Overview**

### **Goal:**

A simple yet smart **AI-powered project planner & tracker** that helps individuals break down their **personal projects** into structured **tasks, phases, sprints, and timelines** using AI. The system provides structural planning followed by a interactive chatbot for refining.

---

## **🛠 Workflow Breakdown**

### **🔹 Step 1: User Provides Project Details**

✅ **Project Name & Type**

✅ **Resources & Tools** (Tech stack, docs, frameworks, etc.)

✅ **Deadline**

✅ **Preferred Working Hours/Week** (Optional)

✅ **(Optional) Task List & Time Estimates** (For users with a rough plan)

👉 **AI Output (Generated Plan):**

- AI **analyzes input** and **creates a structured project lifecycle**.
- **Breaks down the project into tasks, phases, and sprints**.
- **Assigns estimated deadlines** for each deliverable.

---

### **🔹 Step 2: AI-Chatbot Discussion for Refinement**

✅ Once the plan is generated, the user **talks to the AI chatbot** for fine-tuning.

✅ The chatbot asks clarifying questions, such as:

- “Would you like to add a design phase before development?”
- “Should we allocate more time for testing?”
- “Would you like AI to suggest a different task order?”
✅ Users can also **edit tasks manually** or **ask AI to suggest improvements**.

👉 **Finalized Plan Output:**

- A well-structured **project timeline with sprints, tasks, and deadlines**.
- AI ensures **realistic estimations & optimized scheduling**.
- The user gets a **downloadable/interactive roadmap**.

### **🔹 Step 3: Project Tracking & Dynamic Adjustments**

Once the plan is set, the system provides:

✅ **Task Completion Tracking** – Users mark tasks as done.

✅ **Deadline Adjustments** – If delays happen, AI **recalculates** the schedule.

✅ **AI-Powered Nudges** – Encourages users to **stay on track** and prioritizes tasks dynamically.

✅ **Chatbot Support** – Users can chat with AI to make modifications anytime.
